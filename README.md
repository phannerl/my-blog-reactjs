- Vite for fast development and HMR (Hot Module Replacement)
- ESLint for linting and code quality
- Jest for unit testing

## Project Structure

- `src/` - Contains the source code
- `public/` - Static assets
- `dist/` - Production build output

## ESLint Configuration

To ensure code quality and consistency, ESLint is configured with the following settings:
- AirBnB style guide
- TypeScript support
- React plugin

You can expand the ESLint configuration by updating the `parserOptions` and `extends` in `.eslintrc.cjs`.
